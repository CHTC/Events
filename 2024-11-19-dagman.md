Hosted by the OSG Facilitation team, in this training, you will be guided through hands-on exercises to learn how to use DAGMan to automate your HTCondor job submissions. This training is especially useful for anyone who has constructed different job types and wants to be able to run them in a certain order. 

Training is a mix of presentation and hands-on. We recommend joining this training with a basic understanding of HTCondor job submission.
