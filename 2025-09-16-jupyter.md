Are you new to the OSPool? This short workshop will help you get started on the OSPool through the Jupyter Hub interface. We’ll introduce and explore the interface, submit HTCondor jobs, and discuss workflows suitable for this resource. An OSPool account is not required for this training.

### Prerequisites

* Optional: OSPool account on AP40
