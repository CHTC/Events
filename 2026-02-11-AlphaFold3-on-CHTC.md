**Tutorial: Running AlphaFold3 on CHTC**
Join CHTC facilitators for a hands-on tutorial focused on running AlphaFold3 on CHTC GPU resources, from single-protein predictions to larger, high-throughput structural biology workflows.

This session is designed for researchers who already understand the basics of AlphaFold-style modeling and want to run AlphaFold3 efficiently on shared research infrastructure—without needing to manage local GPUs or large databases themselves.

**Co-Hosted Event** - _This event will be co-hosted with a special tutorial on using AlphaFold3 on CHTC resources from 2:30 - 3:30 PM CT, followed by an open coworking session from 3:30 - 4:30 PM CT. **All those interested in using AlphaFold3 on CHTC are welcomed!**_

**Who Should Attend?**

This tutorial is ideal for:
* Structural biologists and bioinformaticians using AlphaFold3
* Researchers modeling protein complexes, multimers, or variants
* Users looking to move beyond single-machine or local GPU runs
* Anyone interested in scalable, reproducible AlphaFold3 workflows

No prior experience with CHTC is required, but familiarity with AlphaFold or AlphaFold3 concepts will be helpful.

**Requesting AlphaFold3 Weights Early (Can take several days):**
If you would like to follow along, please make sure to request the AlphaFold3 model parameters using the form linked on the [Alphafold3 GitHub Repository](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold3?tab=readme-ov-file#obtaining-model-parameters). Please be aware that this is a process handled by Google's DeepMind team and can take several days to weeks after the request. Make sure to upload your parameter file to your CHTC home directory once you receive it!

**Bioinformatics Café**

This event is part of the Bioinformatics Café, a monthly, community-focused series that combines short technical tutorials with dedicated coworking time. The Café is designed to help researchers make real progress on their computational biology projects while connecting with peers and CHTC facilitators in a relaxed, supportive environment.

Whether you want to tackle a tricky bioinformatics problem, get hands-on help with CHTC/OSPool workflows, or simply co-work on your project in a collaborative environment, the Bioinformatics Café is the perfect place to make progress and meet fellow researchers.
