This year's European HTCondor Workshop will be held from September 16 to 19th, at the Institute of Physics at the Czech Acadamy of Science in beautiful Prague.

We are still building the agenda, as list of potential talks from the HTCondor team and other accepted talks will soon be available  under the Contribution List link on the Indico meeting site. 

We also would very much like to know about your use of HTCondor, in your project or at your site, your experiences as a user or as an administrator and your plans. Hence you are strongly encouraged to propose a short presentation - abstract submission will be opened by the end of the week. Workshop themes include Data, User Experiences, Installation and Upgrades, Monitoring, Architectures, Security, and Policies and Customisations but donâ€™t be limited by that we are happy to accept other relevant talks.
 
Participation is open to all organisations (including companies) and persons interested in HTCondor (and by no means restricted to particle physics and/or academia!) If you know potentially interested persons, don't hesitate to make them aware of this opportunity.
 
If you have any questions, please contact [hepix-2025condorworkshop-support@hepix.org](mailto:hepix-2025condorworkshop-support@hepix.org)
 
We are looking forward to seeing you a rich, productive workshop.
 
Chris Brew (STFC - RAL) and Christoph Beyer (DESY)
Co-Chairs of organising committee.
 
Alexandr Mikula
Chair of the Local Organising Committee
