**New to High Throughput Computing or need a refresher?**
 
Join our "Getting Started with High Throughput Computing" workshop, where we’ll introduce CHTC’s High Throughput Computing system, components of a job, and how to handle data. In this workshop, users will practice how to transfer data, submit jobs, and debug simple job errors. A basic understanding of the command line is recommended.
