**Join CHTC facilitators at the Bioinformatics Café for a tutorial on installing and managing bioinformatics software using Conda and containers on CHTC!**

This session is focused on one of the most common pain points in computational biology: reproducible, portable software environments. We’ll cover practical strategies for installing bioinformatics tools using Conda/containers and when containers (Apptainer/Singularity) are the better choice for running workflows on shared computing resources like CHTC and the OSPool.

The Bioinformatics Café is a welcoming space to learn, ask questions, and make real progress on your research alongside peers and CHTC facilitators. Bring your research, your questions, and your curiosity—we look forward to working with you!

Whether you want to tackle a tricky bioinformatics problem, get hands-on help with CHTC/OSPool workflows, or simply co-work on your project in a collaborative environment, the Bioinformatics Café is the perfect place to make progress and meet fellow researchers.
