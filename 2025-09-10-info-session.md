**Do you need more computing resources for your research?** Do you need more memory, GPUs, or just have lots of calculations to run?
 
Come learn about research computing, its many shapes and flavors, and how the Center for High Throughput Computing can help you scale up your computational work. We'll cover the differences between High Throughput and High Performance Computing and help you figure out which one is right for you.
 
Whether you're completely new to research and computers or an experienced batch computing user, any UW-Madison affiliate who needs computing for their research can make an account with us!
 
After the presentation, stick around to talk to the facilitators about getting started at the Center for High Throughput Computing.
