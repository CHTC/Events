This workshop is designed to introduce software containers such as Docker, Apptainer, and Singularity. Content covered includes how to create a container, use a container, and techniques for troubleshooting containerized software. There are no prerequisites for this workshop, however, a basic understanding of HTCondor job submission and HTCondor submit files will make it easier to understand the content presented.
