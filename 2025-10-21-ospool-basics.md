Learn how to scale your research using the OSPool, a high throughput computing (HTC) resource for running large numbers of computational jobs. This training will introduce the fundamentals of HTC, guide you through getting started on the OSPool, and include a hands-on walkthrough where you'll submit and manage your own jobs. Ideal for researchers who want to scale their analyses efficiently and new/prospective OSPool users.

### Prerequisites
* Some familiarity with shell commands, such as how to edit files, copy/paste in the terminal
* Recommended: OSPool account

All User Training sessions are offered from 2:30-4:00pm EST on the third Tuesday of the month. It's best to already have an active OSPool account to follow along with hands-on examples, but anyone can listen in by registering.
