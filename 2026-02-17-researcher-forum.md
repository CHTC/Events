In this event, you will have a chance to: 
* Learn about recent changes at CHTC and what’s new and upcoming
* Connect with CHTC users and learn from each other about their use of CHTC at a mini poster session
* Engage with CHTC staff – ask questions, provide suggestions, and more!

We hope that this is an event that empowers all CHTC users and relevant community members to start and continue conversations with us as collaborative research partners.
