The OSG OSPool provides access to a diverse set of compute resources with varying CPU architectures and specialized hardware like ARM64 and GPUs. This short training introduces researchers to the key differences between ARM64, x86_64 and  x86_64 microarchitectures, discusses how to build and run portable software across them, and outlines considerations for targeting GPU-enabled resources. Attendees will learn how to request specific hardware types in their jobs, optimize for performance and compatibility, and ensure their jobs take full advantage of the available heterogeneity in the OSPool.

### Prerequisites
* Familiarity with shell commands, such as how to edit files, copy/paste in the terminal
* Some familiarity with using and building containers
* Recommended: OSPool account
