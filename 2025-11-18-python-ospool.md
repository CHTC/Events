Many programs used by researchers are written in Python. In this training, you'll learn how to set up and use Python in the OSPool. We'll start with how to deploy a consistent software environment, primarily through the use of containers. We'll also cover how to use Conda for managing and deploying Python environments. Then we'll cover how to set up your execution script for running Python jobs. Finally, we'll discuss the practical considerations for adapting your Python programs to a high throughput computing system.

### Prerequisites
* Some familiarity with shell commands, such as how to edit files, copy/paste in the terminal
* Some familiarity with Python
* Recommended: OSPool account
