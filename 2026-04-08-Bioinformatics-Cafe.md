**Join CHTC facilitators at the Bioinformatics Café for a tutorial on genome assembly using Oxford Nanopore sequencing data on CHTC!**

This session focuses on practical strategies for assembling genomes from long-read Nanopore data using shared computing resources. We’ll discuss how to run long-read assemblers efficiently, manage large input datasets, and take advantage of CHTC’s high-memory and high-throughput capabilities to move beyond laptop- or lab-server–scale assemblies.

The Bioinformatics Café is a welcoming space to learn, ask questions, and make real progress on your research alongside peers and CHTC facilitators. Bring your research, your questions, and your curiosity—we look forward to working with you!

Whether you want to tackle a tricky bioinformatics problem, get hands-on help with CHTC/OSPool workflows, or simply co-work on your project in a collaborative environment, the Bioinformatics Café is the perfect place to make progress and meet fellow researchers.
