Join CHTC facilitators for a training focused on integrating ResearchDrive data with CHTC resources,
covering manual transfers on HPC and HTC systems and automated transfers of data on the HTC system.

This session is designed for researchers who want to utilize the storage space in ResearchDrive ([it.wisc.edu/services/researchdrive](https://it.wisc.edu/services/researchdrive/)) to support their computing workflows.

**Who Should Attend?**

This training is targeted at CHTC users with access to ResearchDrive,
but may be of interest to anyone with access to ResearchDrive or anyone doing computing with large amounts of data.

No prior experience with CHTC is required, but familiarity with ResearchDrive and the command line will be helpful.
